# Ideas and origins
I got a good book during my first job 4-year ago: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ (Fourth Edition) - Mark Allen Weiss. For a while, I tried methodically to implement all Data Structures & Algos I've learned in the book every weekend.

Of course, I only finished a handful of these DSs from scratch, but they taught me a lot about both C++ and DS & Algo :)

Definitely a very good book and a good memory to keep.

PS: I can't claim all the codes here are mine, just most of the tweaks & for educational purpose only. 
Cheers.

Many C++11 features are used - successfully compiled and tested the programs under g++ 4.6.2. IMPORTANT: the code WILL NOT compile on pre-C++11 compilers.

Prominent features that are used include: auto, uniform initialization (i.e. the use of braces instead of the prior style of parentheses in constructor initialization lists), long long, deduced return types (occasionally), nullptr (define to 0 if not supported), right angle brackets (>> is now ok in nested template instantiation), rvalue references and moves, range-based for loops, and some library features such as the random number generation facility.
