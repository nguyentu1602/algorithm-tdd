# algorithm-tdd
Implement classical algorithms and data structures under test-driven development.

In this repo I will develop basic algorithms and data structures in C++ while strictly adhering to a test-driven workflow.
I have consulted several books and resources before starting this project, most notably:
  - CLRS's Introduction to Algorithms
  - Miller & Ranum's Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python
  - M. A. Weiss's Data Structures & Algorithm analysis in C++
  - The C++ STL source code

The algorithms and data structures I choose to implement are all well-known and thus this repo is solely for my learning purpose. Whenever possible, I will also write-up my attempts of profiling and empirically analyzing complexities of these algorithms.
